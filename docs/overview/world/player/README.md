# Player

## Overview

- The [player] is a *KinematicBody2D*.
- Movement is applied manually with its script.
- Terrain is generated (and will unload/load) as the player moves back and forth.
- Everything the player does is an *action*. There are object-specific actions, non-object actions and object-independent actions (see the [gdd](/DESIGN.md)).
