## Game Overview

### Game Concept
After having an office job for a few decades, you decide to start a new life, wandering around in forests and meadows.

### Genre
Open world, exploration

### Target Audience

### Game Flow Summary
- The player can walk left and right and jump and climb up and back down.
- He can not go underground, because there are no caves and terrain is unmovable.
- The player can also warp to different "dimensions", which represent different areas of the world. Different areas are generated by inputting a different y value to the procedural generation algorithms.
<!-- How does the player move through the game.   Both through framing interface and the game itself. -->

### Look and Feel
<!-- What is the basic look and feel of the game?  What is the visual style? -->

## Gameplay and Mechanics

#### Game Progression

#### Mission/challenge Structure

#### Puzzle Structure

#### Objectives
- **To win**: Gain a certain amount of experience.
<!-- What are the objectives of the game? -->

#### Play Flow
<!-- How does the game flow for the game player -->

### Mechanics

Player Attributes:
- *hunger*

<!-- What are the rules to the game, both implicit and explicit.  This is the model of the universe that the game works under.  Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces interact?  This actually can be a very large section. -->

#### Physics
Earth physics
<!-- How does the physical universe work? -->

#### Movement in the game
A and D, and Space

#### Objects
- Definition:
  - *An object is any tangible thing that isn't in the form of a tile.*
- Properties:
  - Are affecting by gravity
  - Can be picked up (on collision) and stored in the player's inventory (automatically)
- List:
  - (Every structure tile takes the form of an object when dropped.)
<!-- how to pick them up and move them -->

#### Actions
- Definition:
  - *An action is anything that would give someone noticeable (out-of-the-norm) experience with nature IRL.*
- Properties:
  - Every action has an experience value, which is rewarded to the player every time it is completed.
- List (experience values TBD):
  - *Actions directed to self*:
    - Eat
    - Sleep
    - Warp
  - *Actions directed to structures*:
    - Cut down (any structure)
      - Removes structure
      - Drops a percentage of the structure's tiles
    - Build (certain structures)
    - Plant (plant structures)
    - Pick (off plant structures)
  - *Actions directed to objects*:
    - Chop up (any object)
    - Burn (any object)
<!-- Including whatever switches and buttons are used, interacting with objects, and what means of communication are used -->

#### Combat
No combat *yet*
<!-- If there is combat or even conflict, how is this specifically modeled? -->

#### Economy
- Currency is experience.
  - Obtained by completing certain actions.
  - Used for winning the game.

#### Screen Flow
- Main screen
- Inventory screen
<!-- A graphical description of how each screen is related to every other and a description of the purpose of each screen. -->

### Game Options
<!-- What are the options and how do they affect game play and mechanics? -->

### Replaying and Saving

- Every game can be saved and loaded.
- A menu will contain a list of all saves.
- There is no limit to the number of saves.

### Cheats and Easter Eggs

## Story, Setting and Character  

### Story and Narrative
- Your office job has made you reach breaking point, so you decide that enough is enough and go out into the woods.
<!-- Includes back story, plot elements, game progression, and cut scenes.  Cut scenes descriptions include the actors, the setting, and the storyboard or script. -->

### Game World

#### General look and feel of world

- **Season**: Every game randomly selects a season, which is used for the entire game.
- **Biomes**: Biomes vary throughout the game world; they affect things like tile tint color, resources and weather.

#### Areas
<!-- Including the general description and physical characteristics as well as how it relates to the rest of the world (what levels use it, how it connects to other areas) -->
- Modeled after Earth
- Tiles:
  - **Terrain tiles**:
    - List:
      - *Grass*
      - *Dirt*
      - *Stone*
      - *Sand*
      - *Water*
    - Mechanics
      - Indestructible, though certain terrain tiles can be transformed into other terrain tiles after terrain generation (such as grass -> dirt and dirt -> grass).
      - Blocking (cannot be walked through)

  - **Structure tiles**:
    - List:
      - *Log*
      - *Leaves*
      - *Corn plant*
      - *Corn*
    - Mechanics
      - Destructible
      - Not blocking (can be walked past)

### Characters
<!-- Each character should include the back story, personality, appearance, animations, abilities, relevance to the story and relationship to other characters -->

## Levels

### Level

There is only one level, nature.

<!-- Each level should include a synopsis, the required introductory material (and how it is provided), the objectives, and the details of what happens in the level.  Depending on the game, this may include the physical description of the map, the critical path that the player needs to take, and what encounters are important or incidental. -->

### Training Level

The player has to learn as she goes, so there is no training level.

## Interface

### Visual System.
<!-- If you have a HUD, what is on it?  What menus are you displaying? What is the camera model? -->

### Control System
<!-- How does the game player control the game?   What are the specific commands? -->

### Audio, music, sound effects

### Help System

Only to help player understand how to interact with the world, but nothing more.

## Artificial Intelligence

Animals would be a cool feature, or some sort of NPC. [TODO]

### Opponent and Enemy AI
<!-- The active opponent that plays against the game player and therefore requires strategic decision making -->

### Non-combat and Friendly Characters

### Support AI -- Player and Collision Detection, Pathfinding

## Technical

### Target Hardware

### Development hardware and software, including Game Engine

### Network requirements

## Game Art

This is an open source and open asset project. If you don't feel comfortable making your asset contributions open, please open a pull request, and we will reconsider it!

### Sprites

*The game will use a pixel art style.*

- Player
- (All tiles)
<!-- Key assets, how they are being developed.  Intended style. -->
