# Info Nodes

## Overview

[Info nodes] store global information about a feature, such as the [terrain's][terrain] heightmap or where [forests][forest] should be. Use info nodes when data is *feature-specific*, meaning they are relevant to multiple scripts of the same feature. If data is only relevant to a single script, then avoid using info nodes.
