# The Game World

The world holds everything for playing the actual game (opposed to menus, etc.).

Note that it is flipped vertically, and everything in the world (besides the terrain map) is re-flipped to correct itself. This way, the bottom of the ground is zero, and up is positive, which makes using tile-space a lot more simple.
