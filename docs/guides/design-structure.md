# Designing Structures

## Procedure

Structures are groups of structure tiles that can be interacted with as an entire entity.

1. Create a scene extending *structure/base/Structure.tscn*, or one of its decedents, and save it in *structure/LAYER_NAME/STRUCTURE_NAME* (LAYER_NAME may be omitted, depending on the structure).
2. Choose a tile layer and create any tiles that compose the structure on that layer.
