# Terrain Notes

- Organic at top, and less organic as you go down (dark -> rock bits)
- Underneath that, about 20-30m down: bedrock (with holes and cracks for water)
- Water sifts down to bedrock, and permeates through top bedrock and can't go through bottom bedrock.
- Under lake, water saturates all the way down. Other places, it gets more wet as level decreases
- Water table is at the same level as tops of the lake
